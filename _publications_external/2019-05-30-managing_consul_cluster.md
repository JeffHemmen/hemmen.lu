This is an article about the Consul provider for Terraform, not the backend. This is about using Terraform as a way to manage your Consul cluster’s configuration from a centralised Terraform project.
If you are only interested in using Consul as a backend for Terraform, i.e. to store state and locking information, this article will not be very relevant to you. (But hopefully still interesting.)
