Ben Shonubi and new co-host Andy Tebb, Head of Pre-Sales at ECS, are joined by some very special guests - Jeff Hemmen a DevOps & Continuous Delivery Consultant at ECS and John Boero Channel Solution Engineer at HashiCorp

On this episode they discuss everything #ZeroTrust, who manage it and how it is not something which has just burst onto the scene but is picking up traction. What should CIO, CISOs and cyber security engineers look out for? Is the new cycle in shifting security left the introduction of continuous identity? And what is HashiCorp Boundary?
