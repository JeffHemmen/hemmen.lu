Serverless backend platforms are cloud services that simplify the process of building a backend. These platforms are growing rapidly in popularity because they can greatly accelerate application development, and improve the developer experience. Convex is a real-time backend platform that uses 100% TypeScript and is designed with reactive UI frameworks in mind. The team behind Convex has built and maintained some of the most popular apps, backends and exabyte-scale storage projects at companies like Dropbox and Google.
James Cowling is the Co-Founder and CTO at Convex, and he joins us to discuss how Convex offers a simpler full-stack developer experience.
